## Fedora setup script
Bash script that installs most KDE applications and many development tools on
Fedora 36 systems, using the [KDE Spin](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/kde) as a starting point.
It also sets some configuration options useful for development work and system administration.

#### Notes
- Repositories that use $releasever need to be checked before performing a
system upgrade to see if packages for target release are available.
